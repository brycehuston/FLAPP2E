## Introduction

The gaming industry has witnessed unprecedented growth, with mobile gaming revenues exceeding $100 billion annually. However, traditional gaming models extract value from players without providing meaningful returns for time invested. FLAPP2E bridges this gap by creating a sustainable play-to-earn economy where skill and dedication are directly rewarded.

### Vision Statement
